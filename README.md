# count-my-vultr
Counts how many instances you have and displays it.

Just install the extension (instructions: https://blog.hunter.io/how-to-install-a-chrome-extension-without-using-the-chrome-web-store-31902c780034)

When you're on the Server page and in the Vultr instances tab you will see a count of all active instances next to the Instances tab (eg. "Instances (25)").
